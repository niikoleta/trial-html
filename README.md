# trial-html
<p> My first trial to code ever. Starting off with learning html. </p>
<p> I'll try to do simple tasks and practice on learning tags and attributes. </p>
<p> I'll upload my file from atom as it does not synchronize with GitHub. Or else, I can't find this alternative. </p>
<p> I also have no idea what I'm doing right now. It is all so  new to me. But I've got the seperate rows correct. </p>
